ENCRYPTION AND DECRIPTION PROJECT
	This project was made in order to gain some understanding of how the encryption process works and how some files are encrypted. This project is made up of two programs. One of these programs encrypts a file using a version of the Ceasar Cipher that works off of pseudorandomly generated numbers. The user will enter in the phrase that they wish to have encrypted and saved to a text file. The program then logs the numbers used to encrypt the file which creates the key. After the encryption process is complete the programs saves the key and the ecrypted message to their own separate files. When the user wants to decrypt the message they must start the decryption program. When starting the program the user will tell the program the file that is encrypted and the key that needs to be used to decrypt the line of text. After that the program will decrypt the message and display it on the screen.

GETTING STARTED
	This program is written completely in python. If you are running a linux or OSX machine python should already be installed on your system. For Windows users simply go to the python webite and download the installer for the latest version of python 3.6 and run it on your machine. The correct url for downloading python to windows is https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/.

INSTALLING
If python is not installed on your system refer to the getting started section to download the latest stable version of python to your computer

1. Download the zip file and save it to any location on the computer you like.

2. Locate the zip file and right click on it.

3. Find the option to extract or unzip the file and click on the option.

4. After extracting the zip file you should be able to access the files and run them on your machine.

RUNNING TESTS
	Because of the nature of python and how simple each program is it is suggested that you use print statements after every variable declaration in the program to help identify what might be causing a problem in the code. After adding the print statements run the program again and look for anything that may be wrong in the code.

BUILT WITH
	This project was built in IDLE using python 3.6 and utilizes the random numbers library to encrypt text files and create the decryption key.

CONTRIBUTION
	If anyone wishes to contribute to the project please feel free to contact me using the email displayed on my profile. If you have edited the code please inform me of the changes made so that I can edit the README file. Also since this project was just to gain some amount of education on cryptography and security please feel free to send any advice or tips that can help to make the program better. Any information at all is welcome.
